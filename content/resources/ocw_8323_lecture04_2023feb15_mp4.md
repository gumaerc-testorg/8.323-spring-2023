    \nCanonical quantization of a free scalar field theory, canonical commutation\
    \ relations, mode expansion, a free field theory can be viewed as an infinite\
    \ number of harmonic oscillators, expressing the Hamiltonian and other conserved\
    \ charges in terms of oscillators, vacuum energy, structure of Hilbert space \n\
